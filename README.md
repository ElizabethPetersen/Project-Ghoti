  <h1>This is the start of Project Ghoti, a beginner coding project. Welcome!</h1>
  <h2>What is Project Ghoti?</h2>
  <p1>Project Ghoti is still forming, and so is the idea of it. But basically, it is an open source, beginner coding project.</p1>
  <h3>Are there any other places I can find this project?</h3>
  <p2>Yep! We're currently setting up a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/projectghoti">facebook page</a> and a home page.</p2>
  <h3>What's with the name?</h3>
  <p4>"Ghoti" is actually pronounced like "fish". The "gh" is from laugh, the "o" is from women, and the "ti" is from information.</p1>
  <h4>Now that you're acquainted with Project Ghoti, welcome!</h4>
  <p>Although this project doesn't look like much right now, we hope for it to turn into something much bigger. Some of our goals include: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Helping more people learn how to code, not matter their background or experience.</li>
    <li>Hiring more highschoolers to teach coding lessons.</li>
    <li>Giving more kids the opportunity to meet up and code together.</li>
  </ul>
